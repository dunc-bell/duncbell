<p>Finished <em>Headshot</em> by Rita Bullwinkel. I’m not good at articulating what I like in a book but this really hooked me.</p>

<p>I picked up <em>Wish I was here</em> by MJ Harrison, again after finishing Headshot. Then read a few of his blog entries before bed time. I love his writing. I think <em>Climbers</em> is such a fantastic novel. <em>Light</em> I found quite hard work. His social media and blogging is great.</p>
