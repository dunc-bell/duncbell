          #            It's often something like `sftp.porkbun.com` or similar,

          #            This is the web root directory on Porkbun's server where your
          #            website files should be placed to be publicly accessible.
          #            For Porkbun Static Hosting, this is often just `/` (the root directory)
          #            or sometimes `/www`. It is LESS LIKELY to be `/public_html`
          #            for static hosting specifically (that's more common for cPanel).
          #            You MUST CONFIRM this with Porkbun's documentation for your
          #            static hosting or their support.
