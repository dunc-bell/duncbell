We took A to Saluhallen to eat falafel and chips. He was an expert dipper. Definitely not his first time. Amusing to watch him dip into the mustard instead of the ketchup. It definitely caught him by surprise. He still seemed under the weather but enjoyed climbing on the crazy bear, goose, boar, snake, deer statue in the park. 

Finished *Headshot* by Rita Bullwinkel. It’s great. Such power and clarity. I’m not good at articulating what I like in a book but this really hooked me. 

I picked up *Wish I was here* by MJ Harrison, again for 15 minutes after finishing Headshot. Then read a few of his blog entries before bed time. I love his writing. I think *Climbers* is such a fantastic novel. *Light* I found quite hard work but wonder how focused I was when reading it. His social media and blogging is great.
