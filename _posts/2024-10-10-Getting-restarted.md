I finally decided to re-claim my own space on the web. This time I wanted something a bit easier to maintain - the previous incarnation was a wordpress - and a lot cheaper - I got stung with some crazy high renewal fees with my last web hosts. After About 20 minutes of Chat GPT and Reddit research I decided to host on github, and re-register my domain from a much cheaper source (I also chose to register for three years, so perhaps this version will live a bit longer than the, now disappeared, portfolio one).

My aim is to have something a bit more reflective of me. Not just a professional page. Precisely what that means, I don't know. But I will re-write at least one post that I lost and add a few things that I've been working with recently.
